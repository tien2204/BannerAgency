                            Things to be careful are:
                            - When you refine, avoid any potential overlapping of elements.
                            - When you change the position of an element, consider step by step whether the relative positions of other elementsâ€”especially those that reference the changed element need to be adjusted to avoid disrupting the layout.
                            - When change the relative positions, you should always remember to update the position with the new relative positions, because relative position always affects positions.
                            - When changing elements, ensure the margins to the edges are considered. Check by calculating if the (position+size) exceeds ({background_width}, {background_height}) in horizontal and vertical dimension respectively.."""
